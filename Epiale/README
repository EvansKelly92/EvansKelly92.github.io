This folder is for Ethan Epiale and contains art made by him.

How to upload! This is for you Ethan as no one else is allowed on this repo, I'll put it in baby steps:

1. Make your art.
2. Save your art as '(overall page number).png' so like '3.png' if it continues a story don't do 'ch2-1.png' find the last page number from before and start naming from there. Like if the last one was 27 start the new section on 28.
3. Click into the story folder and then click into the pages folder.
4. On the upper right click 'Add files' then 'Upload files' add your pngs.
5. Add a comment about what you are uploding, ie "pages for chapeter two" or whatever. This might seem pointless but they are good to have in case something messes up.
6. In the options make sure 'commit directly to the 'main' branch' is selected. 
  6.1. If it says something other than 'main' then you are in the wrong spot on this repo. On the upper left, click 'code'
  6.2. on the upper right under 'EvansKelly92.github.io' theres a dropdown box with a line that branches, click that and select main
  6.3. Go back to step 3 and repeat.
7. Click 'Commit Changes' (it's green)
8. Let Github do its thing. It will take up to 10 minutes to update the webpage.

Note, if you want a new folder for a diffrent comic or like me to add any sort of website magic or add in like a link to an archive/chapter let me know and we'll work something out.
